# t3hmun.github.io - First attempt to write static site framework in js.

__Epitaph__

1. This is abandoned.
1. This project was a learning excercise, my first non-trivial project with JavaScript.
1. This is not good code.
1. Was writing a static site generator, avoiding use of exisiting packages and frameworks on purpose.
1. The design was far too open ended to be successful.
1. I learned how to propgate errors in promises and callbacks.
1. Flow is nowhere near as nice as the magical comfy land of C# + VisualStudio + Resharper with annotations.
