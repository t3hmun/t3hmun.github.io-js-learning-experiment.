## Frontmatter

The document starts with some frontmatter written in json.
This json will be removed before processing the markdown.
Json was chosen for convenience and it does not interfere with syntax highlighters much (in contrast Yaml gets confused for all sorts of markdown constructs).

__layout__
: Specifies the layout template to use after processing the markdown.

__description__ 
: Used for metadata and descriptions on index pages.


## Title and Date

* The title date are in the filename.
* The title and date are inserted by the layout.
* The writer should not repeat the date or title in the markdown. 

* The title is `<h1>`, so the writer should not use `<h1>` (`# Heading`). 

The HTML5 spec defines an outline algorithm that ignores `h1` to `h6` rank, 
however the HTML5.1 spec was updated with the following warning:

> There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. 
> Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. 
> Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure

This means that the `h1` to `h6` ranks remain the de facto way of conveying document structure.
