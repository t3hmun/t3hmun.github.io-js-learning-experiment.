# Salutations

## A Normal Page

This is the a unique content page, uses the universal layout directly.

The universal layout does not set the title (for use in `<title>`,  <`h1`> and metadata).
An appropriate title must be set in the front matter and in the markdown as the `#` first header.

This markdown content will be inserted directly into the HTML5 `<main>` section.

## Should't This Be a Generated Index Page

Yes, but I haven't got around to that yet.
